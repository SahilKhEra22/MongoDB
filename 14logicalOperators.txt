logical operators 

$and
$or
$nor
$not

1. $or
   its value will be list or array in which conditions will be write
    db.students.find({$or:[{age:{$lte:10}},{age:{$gte:12}}]}) 
                          [{first condition},{second condition}]
     $or returns doc only when one of the two condition will be satisfied

2. $nor
   its value will be list or array in which conditions will be write
    db.students.find({$nor:[{age:{$lte:10}},{age:{$gte:12}}]}) 
                          [{first condition},{second condition}]
    $nor returns doc only when nor of conditions will be satisfied  


$or returns one of the condition
$nor returns nothing for matching conditions
     

3. $and
    its value will be list or array in which conditions will be write
    db.students.find({$and:[{age:{$lte:10}},{hobbies:"walk"}]}) 
                        
    $nor returns doc only when both of  conditions will be satisfied  

      
    or
    db.students.find({age:{$lt:5},Hobbies:"walk"})
   it will also give same output 
     note:
     db.students.find({age:{$lt:5},{age:{$gt:12}}) // here in json if we are giving same key then last one will work first one will be ignored

but with $and both conditions will be checked 


4. $not we can also use $ne at the place of this 
   db.students.find({$and:[{age:{$not{$lt:5}}},{age:{$not{$gt:12}}}]})
     
     not operator reverse the meaning means make true false and flase true 
     lt 5 means greater than 5 and gt 12 means less than 12
