1. mongo DB is a database server where we can create a lot of databases 
2. it is non structural database that follows no structure to store data 
3. in it we have database > a database has a collection or collections > a collection has multiple documents 
4. documents are in json format
    ex:- in a database there is a collection of employee name which has a following document

{
"name":"sahil",
"age":23,
"city":"Noida",
"identity":{
"adhaar":932840334,
"pan":"TUJSLDS"
}
}

* we can create a documents till 16 mb



advantages
1. it is flexible because it has no schema because if new data(document ) will come then simply add it is come on number
2. less relations
3. data is stored together



what is BSON

data is in json format for us but behind the seen it is stored in BSON format (binary json )

* BSON's binary structure encodes type and length information,
which allows it to be traversed much more quickly compared to JSON



to stop mongo db servie 
go to cmd > net stop mongoDB
to start 
net start mongoDB



use command in a database show collections to see the collections of the database
