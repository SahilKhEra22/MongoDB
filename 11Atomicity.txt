Atomicity

if we do any transaction like updateOne deleteOne insertOnce

now suppose we have big size document of 50 fields and inserting it in collection , processing of insertion is 25 half and database get stop  and when database will be restart then all the documents will be insert from starting from first field called atomicity 

but when we are using many operations 
suppose we are inserting multiple documents ex:-50 and process is half 25 and somehow database get stop but when database will be restart  the process will be continue after uploaded documents not from starting
