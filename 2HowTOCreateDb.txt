how to create DB in mongo

1. open mongo db shell from c drive presss enter then ctrl + l to clear
2. then use show dbs to see all databases
3. use databsename -> if provided database exists then it will switch to that database otherwise it will create it 

4. now if we want to create a new collection 
   currentDatabase db.students  if in created database students collection exits then it will switch otherwise create 

   curdatabase  db.students.insertOne({name:"sahil",age:23}) -> this will create a document in collection
    after creating a doc we will get a object with acknowledgment true and obj id 

5.  now we want to see
   curdatabasename   db.students.find()  -> db means current open database then collection name then  find() method will searach and display all the documents of that collection
