query 

1. how many students who have worked in 3 companies 

db.collection.find({experience:{$size:3}})  
 this will return doc in which experience field's value will be 3

db.collection.find({experience:{$size:{$gte:3}}})
we can't do this we can't pass expression to $size function

to do this use following

db.collection.find({experience:{$exists:true},{$expr:{$gte:[{$size:"$experience"},3]}}]})
this will first check if experience exists in a doc then apply second query 
in this it will check all the doc in the collection and apply second query only when the first one will be true  


2. students who have hobbies walking and reading

db.collection.find({hobbies:["walking","Reading"]})
 this will return all the doc with the hobbies walking and reading
 but if hobbies will be reading and walking then it will return nothing
 

db.collection.find({hobbies:{$all:["walking","Reading"]}})
 this will return all the doc with the hobbies walking and reading
 it will also return if hobbies will be reading and walking
 but it will return only when both elements will be present in a doc if any of both will be missing then it will return nothing

db.collection.find({hobbies:{$all:["walking","Reading"]}})
this will return doc in which any of both hobbies will be present 
order of element does not matter here

3. document that have at least a product with name apple and quantity greater than 15


ex:-
[{
_id:1,
products:[
{name:"apple",quantity:10},
{name:"orange",quantity:5},
{name:"banana",quantity:20},
]
}]

db.collections.find({$and:[{"products.name":"apple"},{"products.quantity":{$gt:11}}]})

1. this querry will search for all those documents in which name in product field will be apple and quantity will be greater than 11 . it will check doc from outside and who so ever doc will have these to condition even if in diff line will be returned

to search for a particular filed of a doc we use following query

db.collection.find({product.{$elemMatch:{quantity:{$gt:11},name:"apple"}}})
 
this will return only those doc who will have both conditions present in same line
