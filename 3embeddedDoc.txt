 embedded (Nested) documents in mongo

whenever we use $ sign in mongo db means we are using a reserve word 

1. now suppose we want to update a document in database whose name is sahil

* opendatabase  db.collectionname.updateOne({name:"sahil"},{$set:{idCards:{hasPanCard:false,hasAdhaarCard:true}}})

              1. updateOne method is used to update the document's data
              2. it takes two objects as input first one is query  used to find the document with unique data and second is data to be update 
              3. $set operator is used to update the data in mongoDB  if field exists then it get changed otherwise it will be added 
              4. in this case we are adding a new field which is nested object called idCards
              5. means doc inside doc




2. now suppose we want to update all the doc of coll

opendatabse db.collectionname.updateMany({},{$set:{hobbies:["Anime","cooking"]}}) 

                1. here updateMany is used to update all the document
                2. first arguments is empty array which means all the documents
                3. next $set operator will add hobbies filed in all the documents



3. now we want to search only those students which has cooking in their hobbies

 opendatabse db.collectionname.find({hobbies:"cooking"}) // mongoDb is smart will find by itself that hobbies is a array and we are searching for the doucments with hobbies field

4. to count all the documents we use count method
   opendatabse db.collectionname.find({hobbies:"cooking"}).count()

5. now we want documents which has pancard
   opendatabse db.collectionname.find({"idCards.hasPanCard":true})
               1. here it will search for true haspancard field inside idCards    means "key.key":value
