Aggregation part 7

1. Capped Collection in mongoDB
we can set limit to document,how many docs should it contain  what should be the size of collection
ex:-
there is a collection and we want that there will be only 4 docs always 
collection should contain only 4 latest documents 
when we will get a doc and there is already 4 doc in a collection then oldest one will be deleted 

then coll will be created in following way:

db.createCollection("order_logs",{capped:true,max:4,size:100000}) 


 // size will be 1 lakh bites of collection
suppose if there is only 2 docs and size of collection reached its limit 
now one more doc enters in coll then the oldest will also be deleted 


*we can't make existing collection capped collection
*it maintain order of docs like: fifo




2. Using the $out Stage in Aggregation
You can use the $out stage in an aggregation pipeline to copy all documents from one collection to another. This will create a new collection with the same documents as the source collection.
