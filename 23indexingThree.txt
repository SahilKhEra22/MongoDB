indexing part 3

what is a covered query

A covered query is a query in which 

1. all the fields in the query are part of an index
2. all the fields returned in the query are in the same index

ex:-
db.collection.find({name:"mark"},{_id:0,name:1})

it will use index scan because name is a index 
this will find or return only names of documents because we have used projection here and names are index as well means it is a covered query

* winning plan

1. In MongoDB, a winning plan refers to the query execution plan that MongoDB selects as the most efficient for executing a query. MongoDB uses its query optimizer to evaluate multiple possible plans and chooses the one with the lowest estimated cost, which is then referred to as the "winning plan."

In case of multiple indexes for same query
suppose we have created two indexes  name and age
    ex:- name_1_age_1 , name_1

 db.collection.find({name:"mark"}) -> query 

2. we want to search name in collection then search will be done by using index || if we have two and more indexes || mongoDB checks both indexes just before executing the query to ensure that which index will provide result fast 

** in case of multiple indexes:
MongoDB checks the performance of index on a sample of documents once the queries is run and set it as winning plan 

then for second query of similar type it doesn't race them again 

it store the winning plan in cache.

* cache is reset after
1. after 1000 writes
2. index is reset
3. mongo server is restarted
4. other indexes are manipulated


now if we want to see which plan is rejected and which plan is winning plan that you can see in rejectedPlans doc and winning plan doc in the .explain()
