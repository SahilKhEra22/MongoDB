import json in mongoDB

we can do this with mongo import 
our mongoserver should be start to use mongo import
step 1:
first download mongoDB database tools  it was inbuilt before 4.0
install it and copy the path till bin folder 
paste in sys env variables
now we can use mongo import command in cmd


step2:
1.not copy the path of the json file which you want to import
2.open cmd 
3.write mongoimport pastepath -d(databasename) college (if it was not created then will be created) -c(collectioname) students --jsonArray --drop

-d means databasename
-c means collectionname
--jsonArray here we are mentioning that json file is in array form if we don't mention it then all the json file's data will be added to single document
--drop means if collection and database already present then delete them and create again
